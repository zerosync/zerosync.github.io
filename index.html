        <p>ZeroSync aims to take the best features of Dropbox, Owncloud, Sparkleshare, BitTorrent Sync and other cloud sync products. It focuses on a peer to peer communication strategy where all components desktop client, server, mobile app and web app are equal and only differ in the extra service they provide. The key features will be a ultra fast file synchronization ranging from small to super large files, a version control system, secure peer to peer communication and a simple straightforward user management with one time access. The overall goal is a <em>zero effort, intuitive</em> user experience. ZeroSync is LGPLv3 open source.</p>

        <p>During the winter break in January 2013 I (@sappo) finally had some time to build my own private cloud. I needed an easy to setup, comfortable to use solution with version control that would run on my raspberry pi.
        At first I tried owncloud. The especially rich feature set of this project really excited me. After doing lots of optimization on my pi starting from overclocking, reducing the memory footprint to pushing php to it&#8217;s edge and more, I still was stuck with an incredible slow syncing process. It would take almost 45 minutes to sync 300 files on my local LAN. Next I tried Sparkleshare. It has proven itself as stable and I even used it for a couple of weeks with fellow students. By using git under the hood it offers a popular version control system. The problem with, rolling back changes is a really laborious process and it&#8217;s just not optimized for handling large files. When BitTorrent Sync hit the web later 2013 I was amazed by the ease of use. With the peer to peer features I knew from BitTorrent and it&#8217;s great discovery functionality it&#8217;s currently my preferred solution. Even thought BitTorrent isn&#8217;t open source and is also missing a version control.
        As none of the above mentioned project offered a real solution to my problem I started the idea of ZeroSync.</p>

        <p>The core library implements common functionality every component requires. Each component embedding the core will become an <em>ZeroSync Participant</em>. ZeroSync libzs is going to handle the peer to peer communication between participants. It also provides a simple version handling participants can leverage. Further it will pass updates from other participants to store and request to provide data to other participants. Components are different from a storing and providing data point of view. So the implementation for storing and providing data can&#8217;t be part of the core itself and needs to be implemented within the components. A desktop client for example stores and provides data by accessing the local file system, a mobile clients may do so as well. On the other hand a server has to store files in some sort of content repository due to the version control it offers and query them when requested to provide. Ans a web app doesn&#8217;t store any data but may request the metadata and single files for download. Another part of the core will be a discovery functionality which will work at least for the local LAN.</p>

        <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The clients primary task is to watch the file system for changes. Each operation system (Linux, Mac and Windows) has there own methods and functions for this. Therefore each OS needs an own watch implementation.  But we don&#8217;t have to start from scratch here. Open source projects like owncloud already handling this pretty well. One idea could be to fork their client and only use the file system watch part. In case of an updated file the client will inform others about the change. And provide the data once they request it.</p>

Viewing older version of a file and restoring them will be part of the web app. But the API enables each participant to add these features. The version control will happen automatically once a new or updated file is received from another participants. The server also provides files to other clients when requested to.</p>
