<p>ZeroSync aims to combine features of Dropbox, Owncloud, Sparkleshare, BitTorrent Sync and other cloud sync products. Providing rapid file synchronization ranging from small to super large files. Additional features include version control, secure peer to peer communication, simple user management and one time access. The overall goal should be <em>zero effort</em> and <em>simplicity</em> for the user. Another goal for the far future is to add a Dropbox like Datastore API.
ZeroSync is LGPLv3 open source.</p>

<p>During the winter break in January 2013 I (<a href="https://github.com/sappo" class="user-mention">@sappo</a>) finally had some time to build my own private cloud. I needed an easy to setup, comfortable to use solution with version control that would run on my raspberry pi.
At first I tried owncloud. The especially rich feature set of this project really excited me. After doing lots of optimization on my pi starting from overclocking, reducing the memory footprint to pushing php to it's edge and more, I still was stuck with an incredible slow syncing process. It would take almost 45 minutes to sync 300 files on my local LAN. Next I tried Sparkleshare. It has proven itself as stable and I even used it for a couple of weeks with fellow students. By using git under the hood it offers a popular version control system. The problem with, rolling back changes is a really laborious process and it's just not optimized for handling large files. When BitTorrent Sync hit the web later 2013 I was amazed by the ease of use. With the peer to peer features I knew from BitTorrent and it's great discovery functionality it's currently my preferred solution. Even thought BitTorrent isn't open source and is also missing a version control.
As none of the above mentioned project offered a real solution to my problem I started the idea of ZeroSync.</p>

<p>The core library will heavily rely on the awesome messaging framework ØMQ. ØMQ comes with 40+ language bindings. This will allow us to use a broad variety of programming languages and frameworks to build services around the libzs core. 
True to the motto "Choose your own weapon!"</p>
